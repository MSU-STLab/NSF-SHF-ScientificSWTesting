# NSF-SHF-ScientificSWTesting

The code for model creation was taken from https://github.com/ECP-CANDLE/Benchmarks

After ensuring you can run the baseline model (directions may be found in the linked repository), run the associated test file. This will run the 11 metamorphic tests and print the results to the console.

The purpose of this code is to test both Pilot 1 Benchmark 2 and Pilot 3 Benchmark 1 with 11 metamorphic relations taken from a paper which applied these MRs to other machine learning algorithms. The paper is by Xie, Xiaoyuan et al. and is titled “Application of Metamorphic Testing to Supervised Classifiers.”
